Technical and non-technical job postings, along with salaries, are increasing across software engineering, data science, sales, marketing and other skill sectors. Competition is fierce not only from IT providers, but big tech and startups . Even non-tech companies are winning a large share of tech talent.  Discover strategies you can put in place now to upskill employees, tap into the freelance (some call it gig) economy and get creative fast to secure the talent you need.",

      "description": "This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.",

These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.\r\n\r\nIn this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further. You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters. We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.",
