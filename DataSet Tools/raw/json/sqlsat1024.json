Additionally, we will evaluate some open source or multi-cloud alternatives, like Airflow. \r\n\r\nThe session will explore the ease of getting started with each option, go through which languages and infrastructure may be required or supported, and build a short demo of a simple pipeline in each. We will also discuss what the cost differences are to get started and to put into production. ",
