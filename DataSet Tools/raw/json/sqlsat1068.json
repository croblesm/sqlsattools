This session will cover connecting to Power BI Desktop, Power BI Premium Workspaces, and Fabric Workspaces to meet you where you currently are. DAX Studio and Tabular Editor are part of the study guide for the DP-600 exam for Fabric, so this is the perfect time to start learning how to put them to good use.\r\n\r\nThe first tool we will look at is DAX Studio. Its strength is being able to analyze your data separately from Power BI and Fabric. You can use it to quickly gather statistics about multiple semantic models. Has a user reported that one of the reports is running slow? You can use DAX Studio to do DAX performance tuning to make it faster. \r\n\r\nThe second tool is Tabular Editor 2.  It gives you the ability to check to see if your models are following best practices. You can make changes to your models whether they are running in Power BI Desktop, Power BI Premium, or Fabric Workspaces. With Tabular Editor you can use scripts to automate changes that if done manually could take days.\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the topics we will cover as we learn how valuable these tools can be. This session will have the greatest benefit to someone new to DAX Studio and Tabular Editor regardless of where you are on your Fabric journey.\r\n",

            "description": "With the Power BI Team cranking out monthly updates and new features at a mind-boggling rate, it’s hard to keep up with the new preview features.  To help you cut through the white noise, join Susan as she shows off her top ten favorites.\r\nThere are many new features to try each month, but we don’t have time to test everything in the real world.  So, let’s review the most value-added items we can put into play today in our models; ones that will bring along a ‘wow’ factor with a true value-add!  Keep in mind, this list is not even close to an extensive one.\r\nThe May 2023 Fabric Rollout aside, we’ll start the list with creative ways to leverage Field Parameters [previewed 2022], moving on to the New Card visual, Explore! In the Service, DAX INFO Functions, storytelling in PowerPoint and the list goes on…. well at least for 10 items; we only have one hour.  We can also debate the On-Object Interaction functionality, which takes a little time to get used to and then you can’t live without it!\r\nTo get the full list; come on over for a lively discussion and demo rich presentation.  There is always something new to learn; let’s learn together!",

This panel will critically assess the current status of WIT, examining the effectiveness of such investments and identifying areas where expectations have not yet been met. It will highlight the strides made in creating more inclusive technologies and corporate cultures, while also acknowledging the persistence of bias—both conscious and unconscious—that impedes progress. The panel, comprising leading female technologists, diversity and inclusion advocates, and policymakers, will provide a multifaceted perspective on the interplay between gender bias and technology. Through a data-driven approach, we will explore the advancements in AI and machine learning to mitigate biases in hiring and career advancement, the role of mentorship programs, and the impact of policy changes within tech organizations. Moreover, the discussion will offer insights into how the technology created by a more diverse workforce is better equipped to serve a varied user base, leading to more innovative and equitable tech solutions. This session aims to foster a dialogue that not only reflects on the investments made but also charts a course for a more equitable future in technology, where women's contributions are fully recognized and valued.",

In this presentation I will give you a guided tour of each architecture to help you understand its pros and cons. I will also examine common data architecture concepts, including data warehouses and data lakes. You’ll learn what data lakehouses can help you achieve, and how to distinguish data mesh hype from reality. Best of all, you’ll be able to determine the most appropriate data architecture for your needs. And I’ll finish with discussing Microsoft’s version of the data mesh.",

Take some time for yourself during this year's event and spend an hour listening to some tips and tricks for managing the mental and physical stress that comes from being in an on call role. If you're currently in a role like that, my hope is that you'll find this session helpful.

We support a lot of data sources, and we have a few different ways that we can import data into Microsoft Fabric from On Premise.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will go through them.  How do we set up and use a Power BI Data Gateway to get data?  How do we use our existing Self Hosted Integration Runtimes to get data?  What services do we use?\r\n\r\nYou have questions and, in this session, we have the answers!\r\n",

            "description": "It has been nearly 45 years since the concept of a relational database management system (RDBMS) was written down by Edgar Codd. If you work with any technology besides databases, something written down 45 minutes ago may already be obsolete. So why does relational design still matter?\r\n\r\nI will answer that question by showing how to design a database, including the common normal forms and how they make data easy to work with (even if you are not using an RDBMS). Many typical database programming \"difficulties\" result from struggling against how data should be structured and can be avoided by applying basic normalization techniques. Most of these techniques are common sense, but some subtleties cause every designer to occasionally struggle with them, even when the code gives the correct answer (For example, why can't you write:\r\nWHERE ColumnName like '%son' \r\nand the optimizer figure out how to use an index?).

Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.",

Since the introduction of the Query Store (QS) in version 2016 and subsequent rollouts of Intelligent Query Processing (IQP) features in later versions, these enhancements have revolutionized the approach of performance tuning and query optimization. This presentation touches on the historical development of these features and explains how these features now work together to add greater value in version 2022.  Specifically, it will cover the framework of the Query Store for identifying and resolving query performance issues, detail the innovations introduced with the IQP features, and explain how these features work together to automate some of query tuning process. Attendees will gain valuable insights into leveraging the Query Store to swiftly pinpoint performance bottlenecks, understand the mechanics and benefits of the latest IQP enhancements, and master the combined use of QS and IQP for optimal query performance. This session is tailored for both database administrators (DBAs) and developers, aiming to equip them with advanced skills and knowledge to significantly improve their SQL Server performance tuning practices.",

This session will cover connecting to Power BI Desktop, Power BI Premium Workspaces, and Fabric Workspaces to meet you where you currently are. DAX Studio and Tabular Editor are part of the study guide for the DP-600 exam for Fabric, so this is the perfect time to start learning how to put them to good use.\r\n\r\nThe first tool we will look at is DAX Studio. Its strength is being able to analyze your data separately from Power BI and Fabric. You can use it to quickly gather statistics about multiple semantic models. Has a user reported that one of the reports is running slow? You can use DAX Studio to do DAX performance tuning to make it faster. \r\n\r\nThe second tool is Tabular Editor 2.  It gives you the ability to check to see if your models are following best practices. You can make changes to your models whether they are running in Power BI Desktop, Power BI Premium, or Fabric Workspaces. With Tabular Editor you can use scripts to automate changes that if done manually could take days.\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the topics we will cover as we learn how valuable these tools can be. This session will have the greatest benefit to someone new to DAX Studio and Tabular Editor regardless of where you are on your Fabric journey.\r\n",

              "description": "It has been nearly 45 years since the concept of a relational database management system (RDBMS) was written down by Edgar Codd. If you work with any technology besides databases, something written down 45 minutes ago may already be obsolete. So why does relational design still matter?\r\n\r\nI will answer that question by showing how to design a database, including the common normal forms and how they make data easy to work with (even if you are not using an RDBMS). Many typical database programming \"difficulties\" result from struggling against how data should be structured and can be avoided by applying basic normalization techniques. Most of these techniques are common sense, but some subtleties cause every designer to occasionally struggle with them, even when the code gives the correct answer (For example, why can't you write:\r\nWHERE ColumnName like '%son' \r\nand the optimizer figure out how to use an index?).

              "description": "Despite substantial investments from various organizations aimed at bolstering the representation and success of Women in Technology (WIT), the sector continues to grapple with the challenges of bias and underrepresentation. This panel will critically assess the current status of WIT, examining the effectiveness of such investments and identifying areas where expectations have not yet been met. It will highlight the strides made in creating more inclusive technologies and corporate cultures, while also acknowledging the persistence of bias—both conscious and unconscious—that impedes progress. The panel, comprising leading female technologists, diversity and inclusion advocates, and policymakers, will provide a multifaceted perspective on the interplay between gender bias and technology. Through a data-driven approach, we will explore the advancements in AI and machine learning to mitigate biases in hiring and career advancement, the role of mentorship programs, and the impact of policy changes within tech organizations. Moreover, the discussion will offer insights into how the technology created by a more diverse workforce is better equipped to serve a varied user base, leading to more innovative and equitable tech solutions. This session aims to foster a dialogue that not only reflects on the investments made but also charts a course for a more equitable future in technology, where women's contributions are fully recognized and valued.",

Take some time for yourself during this year's event and spend an hour listening to some tips and tricks for managing the mental and physical stress that comes from being in an on call role. If you're currently in a role like that, my hope is that you'll find this session helpful.

Once the code has been committed to source control, moving code between environments can be cumbersome in a manual environment. When multiple changes over time are involved in a release, tracking the proper set of changes is critical. Otherwise, the quality assurance team may test incompatible builds, leading to wasted time and potentially allowing unsupported changes to be deployed together.\r\n\r\nThis session will introduce database developers and administrators to GitHub code repositories and GitHub Actions to define a build and deployment workflow for an Azure SQL database. Several workflow portions will be explained more in-depth, highlighting different tasks written in YAML.\r\n",

So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick’s “Why should I care” series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV’s for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBA is sometimes so moody.",

I will also examine common data architecture concepts, including data warehouses and data lakes. You’ll learn what data lakehouses can help you achieve, and how to distinguish data mesh hype from reality. Best of all, you’ll be able to determine the most appropriate data architecture for your needs. And I’ll finish with discussing Microsoft’s version of the data mesh.",

To help you cut through the white noise, join Susan as she shows off her top ten favorites.\r\nThere are many new features to try each month, but we don’t have time to test everything in the real world.  So, let’s review the most value-added items we can put into play today in our models; ones that will bring along a ‘wow’ factor with a true value-add!  Keep in mind, this list is not even close to an extensive one.\r\nThe May 2023 Fabric Rollout aside, we’ll start the list with creative ways to leverage Field Parameters [previewed 2022], moving on to the New Card visual, Explore! In the Service, DAX INFO Functions, storytelling in PowerPoint and the list goes on…. well at least for 10 items; we only have one hour.  We can also debate the On-Object Interaction functionality, which takes a little time to get used to and then you can’t live without it!\r\nTo get the full list; come on over for a lively discussion and demo rich presentation.  There is always something new to learn; let’s learn together!",

In this session, we will walk through what has changed in the T-SQL landscape over the past several versions of SQL Server, providing practical tips on how to improve an existing code base without installing new SQL Server components.
