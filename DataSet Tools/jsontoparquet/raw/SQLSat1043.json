      "description": "Batch mode was introduced in SQL 2012 and it revolutionized query performance on analytical data.  We don't speak that often on this, but the SQL team does do improvements each release to make scenarios faster.  This talk will go into some details about how modern hardware is evolving and how SQL leverages those advances to deliver best-in-class performance through its batch mode engine.  This talk will go deep into hardware design and behavior, but it is intended to be accessible to those without a deep computer science background.",

It's about teaching new techniques to your peers. It's about expanding your own knowledge on a topic as you prepare a session, present it, and then answer questions. There are very good, career driven, reasons for you to learn to present.\r\n\r\nThis session will go over how to put together a session. From choosing meaningful titles to putting together abstracts, you'll get the information you need to get started. We'll discuss how to build the slides, demonstrations, and more. You'll learn about how to rehearse to get ready for your session. Finally, we'll cover actually giving the session, handling questions, hecklers and other points.\r\n\r\nYou should be standing at the front of the room, giving your own session.

SQL Server 2022 introduces hardware-assisted backup compression using Intel Quick Assist Technology (QAT) that gives you additional backup compression options. You can do full hardware-assisted backup compression, use just the Intel QAT software backup compression, or use traditional Microsoft software backup compression. If your storage subsystem is fast enough, you might decide not to use any form of backup compression.\r\n\r\nHow do you decide what is best for your particular situation and environment? There are many factors to consider, but this session will give you the knowledge and tools to make the best choices for your environment and infrastructure. This is based on extensive testing of most of the available methods and options. You will also learn exactly how to enable and use Intel QAT for backup compression.\r\n",
